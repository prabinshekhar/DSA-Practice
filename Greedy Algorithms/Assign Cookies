  Q) Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.


 public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
      int n = g.length;
      int m = s.length;
      Arrays.sort(g);
      Arrays.sort(s);
      int l=0,r=0,c=0;
      while(l<m && r<n)
      {
        if(g[r]<=s[l])
        {
            r=r+1;
        }
        l=l+1;
      }
      return r;
    }
